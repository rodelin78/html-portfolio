<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated as a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. My very first job after graduation was a Sales Auditor from Robinson's Supermarket,one of the biggest and well-known company in Metro Manila. I also became a Bookkeeper from one of our bank, the Asian Bank and an Internal Auditor from a pre-need company.</p>

<p>When I got married, I decided to be a full time wife. During that time, I put up a small direct selling business, while looking for my family. When my children are growing, financial needs are also increasing. That is why I tried to sell real estate properties. Being lucky to sold units of condominiums monthly and  5 units of condominium during the first wave of pandemic.</p>

<p>My first LOVE! It's the internet, the web. This is my first love ever since. When I'd got the chance to enroll in Udemy and GoIT to learn web developing, I never let off this chance. I study harder to learn everything about web developing. Right now, I'd got my certificate being a full pledge Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
